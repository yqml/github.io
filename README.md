I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Management, Shandong University. I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Statistics, Chinese University of Hong Kong in July 2021, and worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics, Chinese University of Hong Kong until February 2022. Previously, I received my B.S. (Mathematics) from Shandong University.

# Research

My current research interest focuses on machine/deep learning and its application in various scenarios(e.g. quantitative trading, artificial intelligence etc.).
My previous research and publications are primarily on Survival Analysis, Bayesian Methods, Latent Variable Modeling, Semiparametric/Nonparametric Modeling.
